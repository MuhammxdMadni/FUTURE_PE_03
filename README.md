This project was completed as Task 3 of my internship at Future Interns.
The objective of this task was to design and document prompt-powered chatbot personas, focusing on chatbot UX, tone control, and prompt engineering rather than heavy backend development.

The project includes three distinct chatbot personas and one working chatbot demo, created using no-code / low-code tools.
